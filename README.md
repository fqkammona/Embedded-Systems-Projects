# Embedded-Systems-Projects
These are a collection of projects I worked on as part of my ECE:3360 Embedded Systems class. The projects range from safety applications like a lockbox for drivers' phones to utility devices like electronic door locks and signal logging systems. These projects allowed me to delve deeply into Assembly language, C-based programming, serial interface protocols, and microcontroller programming.

#### Disclaimer Note
Please note that for the "Electronic Door Lock" and "Stopwatch" projects, I collaborated with a partner as part of a two-person team. For the "Final Project - Lockbox" and "Signal Logging" projects, I worked independently.

## Final Project - Lockbox 
To combat the rise in texting-and-driving accidents, I created a lockbox for drivers' phones that secures the device until the user's pre-selected destination is reached, using an LCD screen, RGB display, and button for input.

## Electronic Door Lock
In this lab, we were assigned to design and implement a simple electronic door lock system using various components like a seven-segment LED display, shift register, rotary pulse generator, pushbutton switch, and an Arduino Uno. Utilizing hardware debounce and Assembly language, we programmed the ATmega328P microcontroller to meet all the specified conditions for the lock system.

## Signal Logging 
In this lab, I honed my skills in C-based programming for AVR microcontrollers and familiarized myself with various serial interface protocols and converters by constructing a remotely controllable analog signal system using the ATmega328P's A/D converter and the I2C-interfaced MAX518 DAC.

## Stopwatch
In this lab, we engineered and coded a timer using two 7-segment LED displays, shift registers, pushbuttons, and an Arduino Uno, employing hardware debounce techniques and Assembly language to program the ATmega328P microcontroller. The project aimed to meet specific conditions laid out for the timer's functionality. [Read More](https://github.com/fqkammona/Embedded-Systems-Projects/tree/main/Lab-Stopwatch#readme)
